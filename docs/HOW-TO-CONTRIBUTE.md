To send us a pull request, please:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Modify the source** - please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change
3. **Ensure local tests pass** (run `mkdocs serve` to verify your changes work locally)

## Development Setup

### About Package Management

This project uses `uv` for modern Python dependency management with faster installs and reproducible builds.

The repository includes:

- `pyproject.toml` - Project metadata and dependencies
- `uv.lock` - Locked dependency versions for reproducibility

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (for documentation site)
- **Node.js 20 or higher** (for React/Next.js projects)
- **npm or yarn** (for Node.js package management)

### Local Development

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sample-amazon-quick-suite-knowledge-hub.git
cd sample-amazon-quick-suite-knowledge-hub

# Install Python dependencies for documentation
pip install uv
uv sync --dev

# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time)
uv run pre-commit install

# For Node.js projects, navigate to specific project directories
cd docs/use-cases/your-nodejs-project
npm install
```

#### Node.js Project Standards

When contributing Node.js/React/Next.js projects:

**Package.json Requirements:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build", 
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

**ESLint Configuration:**
- Use `eslint-config-next` for Next.js projects
- Include security-focused rules
- Configure for TypeScript if applicable

**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Use strict mode: `"strict": true`
- Include proper path mapping
- Configure for React/Next.js as needed

**Security Best Practices:**
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Avoid hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration

#### Python Project Standards

When contributing Python projects (CDK, Lambda functions, documentation):

**Project Structure:**
```
project/
├── pyproject.toml          # Project metadata and dependencies
├── uv.lock                 # Locked dependency versions
├── requirements.txt        # For Lambda layers (if needed)
└── .gitignore             # Python-specific ignores
```

**pyproject.toml Requirements:**
```toml
[project]
name = "your-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Brief description"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [
    "boto3>=1.26.0",
    "aws-cdk-lib>=2.0.0"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest", "black", "ruff"]
```

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where applicable
- Include docstrings for functions and classes

**Security Best Practices:**
- Keep dependencies updated with `uv sync --upgrade`
- Use `bandit` for security scanning
- Avoid hardcoded credentials
- Use AWS IAM roles and environment variables

That's it! You're ready to develop.

### Serve Documentation Locally

```bash
# Serve documentation locally
uv run mkdocs serve

# View your changes at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Daily Development Workflow

Pre-commit hooks will now run automatically:

```bash
# Make your changes (edit files in your editor)
# For example: add a new integration guide or use case

# Commit (hooks run automatically)
git commit -m "docs: add new integration guide"
# ↑ All quality checks run here (~30-60 seconds)

# Push (documentation build runs automatically)
git push origin my-branch
# ↑ GitHub Actions workflows run here (~2-5 minutes)
```

### What the Hooks Check

**On every commit** (~30-60 seconds):
- ✅ **Python code formatting** (auto-fixes with ruff)
- ✅ **Import sorting** (auto-fixes)
- ✅ **Python linting** (with ruff)
- ✅ **File hygiene** (trailing whitespace, etc.)
- ✅ **Markdown formatting** (auto-fixes)
- ✅ **Security scanning** (bandit for Python, npm audit for Node.js)
- ✅ **Documentation build** (mkdocs build --strict)

**For Node.js projects** (additional checks):
- ✅ **TypeScript/JavaScript linting** (ESLint)
- ✅ **Type checking** (TypeScript compiler)
- ✅ **Build verification** (Next.js/React builds)
- ✅ **Dependency security** (npm audit)

### Skipping Hooks (WIP Commits)

For work-in-progress commits, you can skip checks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "wip: incomplete work"
```

**Please run all checks before opening a PR!**

### Running Checks Manually

**Python project checks:**
```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Run individual Python tools
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run bandit -r .

# Build and serve documentation
uv run mkdocs build --strict
uv run mkdocs serve

# Add new Python dependencies
uv add requests
uv add --dev pytest
```

**Node.js project checks:**
```bash
# Navigate to your Node.js project directory
cd docs/use-cases/your-nodejs-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run build
npm run build

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run security audit
npm audit

# Type checking (for TypeScript projects)
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Building for Production

To build the static site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

The built site will be in the `site/` directory.

## Repository Structure & Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Files and folders**: Use lowercase, substitute dashes for spaces
- **Projects**: Avoid brand names in project/folder names

### Directory Structure

Place your project in the appropriate directory:

```
docs/
├── integration/           # For integration guides
│   ├── knowledge-base/   # Knowledge base integrations
│   └── actions/          # Action integrations
├── use-cases/            # For complete use case examples
└── guidance/             # For how-to guides and best practices
```

### Adding New Content

To add new content to the documentation site:

1. **Add files** to the appropriate directories following naming conventions
2. **Update mkdocs.yml navigation** to make your content visible in the left navigation menu
3. **Include proper frontmatter metadata** in your README.md

**All content requires a mkdocs.yml navigation entry to appear in the left nav.**

#### Examples

**Adding a Use Case:**

```yaml
nav:
  - 💡 Use Cases:
    - Your Project Name: use-cases/your-project-name/README.md  # Add here
```

**Adding Integration Guide:**

```yaml
nav:
  - 🔗 Integration:
    - Your Integration: integration/your-integration.md  # Add here
```

**Adding Guidance:**

```yaml
nav:
  - 📚 Guidance:
    - Your Guide: guidance/your-guide.md  # Add here
```

### Required Files

Each project must include:

- **README.md** - Main documentation with clear setup and usage instructions
- **LICENSE** - License file
- **.gitignore** - Appropriate gitignore file

**For Node.js/React projects, also include:**
- **package.json** - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- **tsconfig.json** - TypeScript configuration (for TypeScript projects)
- **.eslintrc.js/.eslintrc.json** - ESLint configuration
- **next.config.js/ts** - Next.js configuration (for Next.js projects)
