## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- Node.js and npm installed
- Python 3.9 or later
- AWS CDK CLI installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- Amazon Quick Sight Enterprise Edition with Quick enabled

**Required IAM Permissions:**

- CloudFormation (create/update stacks)
- Lambda (create/update functions)
- IAM (create roles and policies)
- CloudWatch Logs (create log groups, put resource policies)
- Cognito (create user pools and clients)
- API Gateway (create APIs)

### 1. Clone Repository (Sparse Checkout)

```bash
# Clone repository with sparse checkout
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-amazon-quick-suite-knowledge-hub.git
cd sample-amazon-quick-suite-knowledge-hub

# Configure sparse checkout for this integration only
git sparse-checkout set docs/manage\ quick/observability-agent
cd "docs/manage quick/observability-agent"
```

### 2. Deploy AgentCore Gateway

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
uv sync
cdk deploy --require-approval never
```

**What gets deployed:**

- AgentCore Gateway with OAuth 2.0 (Cognito)
- Lambda function with 20 monitoring tools
- 3 CloudWatch Log Groups: `/aws/quicksuite/chat`, `/aws/quicksuite/feedback`, `/aws/quicksuite/agent-hours`

## 🎨 Quick Integration

Complete guide to integrate Quick Observability with Amazon Quick using MCP Actions.

### Prerequisites

From your CDK deployment, you'll need:

- `GatewayUrl` - AgentCore Gateway endpoint
- `ClientId` - Cognito Client ID
- `ClientSecret` - Cognito Client Secret
- `CognitoTokenUrl` - OAuth2 token endpoint

### Step 1: Configure MCP Action

**1.1 Access Integrations**

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in Amazon Quick
2. Click on **Actions**
3. Click the **+** button for **Model Context Protocol**

**1.2 Configure MCP Server**

Fill in the MCP configuration:

- **Name**: Quick Observability
- **Description**: Natural language monitoring for Quick using CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and CloudTrail
- **MCP Server Endpoint**: Paste your `GatewayUrl` from CDK deployment outputs
- Click **Next**

**1.3 Configure Authentication**

1. For Authentication, select **Service Authentication**
2. Keep **Service-to-service OAuth** within the Authentication type field
3. Fill in the authentication values from your CDK deployment outputs:

   - **Client ID** → Paste your `ClientId` (ensure no leading/trailing spaces)
   - **Client Secret** → Paste your `ClientSecret` (ensure no leading/trailing spaces)
   - **Token URL** → Paste your `CognitoTokenUrl`

**1.4 Complete Setup**

1. Click **Create and Continue**
2. Select **Next**
3. Select **Next**

### Step 2: Create Quick Agent

**2.1 Access Agents**

1. Navigate to **Agents** in Amazon Quick
2. Click **Create agent**

**2.2 Configure Agent**

- **Agent name**: Quick Observability Agent
- **Description**: Natural language monitoring for Quick using CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and CloudTrail

**2.3 Add Agent Instructions**

Copy and paste the following instructions into the **Agent Instructions** field:

```
You are the Quick Observability Agent with access to monitoring tools that query CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, and CloudTrail.

CORE CAPABILITIES:
• Chat Analysis: View conversations, find errors, search queries, measure performance
• User Feedback: Track satisfaction and feedback patterns
• Usage Monitoring: Agent hours, active users (DAU/WAU/MAU), asset usage
• Performance Health: Dashboards, ingestion, visuals, knowledge bases, connectors, SPICE capacity
• Comprehensive Reporting: Account-wide metrics, API audit trails
• Advanced Analytics: Dynamic schema discovery and custom CloudWatch Insights queries

ADVANCED ANALYTICS:
When pre-built tools don't fit the analysis needed:
1. Call get_log_schema() to discover available fields dynamically
2. Construct CloudWatch Insights query using discovered fields
3. Execute with query_chat_analytics(log_type, query, hours)

CloudWatch Insights syntax:
• fields: Select fields - "fields field1, field2"
• filter: Filter results - "filter field = 'value'" or "filter field > 100"
• stats: Aggregate - "stats count() by field" or "stats avg(field) as avg_value"
  - count_distinct(field) for unique counts
  - Cannot chain multiple stats - use one stats command
• sort: Order - "sort field desc"
• limit: Limit results - "limit 100"

Common patterns:
• Count unique: "fields conversation_id | stats count_distinct(conversation_id) as total"
• Group by: "fields message_scope | stats count() as total by message_scope"
• Filter + aggregate: "filter status_code = 'success' | stats count() as successful"

Note: Do NOT use @timestamp filters - time range is controlled by hours parameter

RESPONSE FRAMEWORK:
1. Acknowledge what you're checking
2. Use appropriate tools (combine multiple for comprehensive analysis)
3. Present data with context and interpretation
4. Highlight key findings and anomalies
5. Provide actionable recommendations
6. Offer follow-up options

TIME RANGE DEFAULTS:
• Real-time troubleshooting: 1-6 hours
• Daily analysis: 24 hours (default)
• Weekly trends: 168 hours (7 days)
• Monthly analysis: 720 hours (30 days)

MULTI-TOOL PATTERNS:
• System health → aggregate_metrics + chat_performance + spice_capacity + chat_errors
• User complaints → user_feedback + chat_errors + chat_conversations
• Usage analysis → active_users + asset_usage + agent_hours_usage
• Performance issues → dashboard_metrics + visual_metrics + ingestion_metrics

DATA INTERPRETATION:
• Error rates >5%: Flag as concerning
• Capacity >80%: Alert proactively
• Zero results: Explain CloudWatch Logs may be empty if Quick unused or logging just enabled
• Anomalies: Highlight and ask if expected

RESPONSE STYLE:
• Professional yet approachable
• Proactive with insights and recommendations
• Clear explanations without jargon
• Always provide next steps
• Data-driven, never assume
• Combine tools intelligently for comprehensive answers

```

**2.4 Add Action to Agent**

1. Scroll to **Actions** section
2. Click **Add action**
3. Select **Quick Observability** (the MCP action you just created)
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test the Agent

Open the agent and try these queries:

```
"Give me a system health overview"
"Show me errors from the last 24 hours"
"How many active users do we have today?"
"What's the average query per conversation?"
"Show me conversations for user vineet"
"What fields are available in chat logs?"
"Show me most used assets"
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Daily Health Check

```
"Give me a system health overview"
```

### Troubleshooting

```
"Why are users reporting errors?"
```

### Usage Analysis

```
"How is Quick being used this week?"
```

### Asset Usage

```
"Show me most used assets"
```

### Custom Analytics

```
"Show me conversations by message_scope"
```

### User-Specific Analysis

```
"Show me conversations for user vineet"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**MCP Authentication Issues:**

- Verify OAuth2 credentials in Quick MCP Actions
- Check Cognito token endpoint configuration
- Ensure client secret is correctly copied (no spaces)

**No Data in CloudWatch Logs:**

- CloudWatch Logs delivery was enabled when stack was deployed
- Only has data from deployment time forward (not historical)
- Check log groups exist: `/aws/quicksuite/chat`, `/aws/quicksuite/feedback`, `/aws/quicksuite/agent-hours`
- Verify Quick is actively being used

**Query Returns Zero Results:**

- Check time range (hours parameter)
- Verify CloudWatch Logs has data for that period
- Use get_log_schema() to confirm field names exist

**AgentCore Gateway:**

- Monitor AgentCore Gateway throttling limits
- Check Lambda timeout (300s) and memory (512MB)
- Review CloudWatch Logs: `/aws/lambda/quicksuite-observability-*`

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources and avoid ongoing charges:

```bash
cdk destroy
```

This will delete:

- Lambda function
- AgentCore Gateway
- Cognito User Pool
- CloudWatch Log Groups (⚠️ **Note**: Log data will be permanently deleted)
- IAM roles and policies

> **Cost Considerations**: This solution incurs costs for Lambda invocations, CloudWatch Logs storage, CloudWatch Metrics queries, and API Gateway requests. Monitor your usage in AWS Cost Explorer.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- **Credentials**: Never commit `ClientSecret` to version control
- **IAM Roles**: The Lambda function uses least-privilege IAM permissions
- **Encryption**: All data in transit is encrypted using TLS
- **Logging**: CloudWatch Logs are retained for 30-90 days (configurable)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with Cognito ensures secure access
- **Rotation**: Consider rotating OAuth credentials periodically
